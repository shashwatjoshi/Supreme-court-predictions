Supreme court predictions.
This project involves the use of Classification and regression trees (CART) model and involves the checking of model sensibility by plotting the ROC curve using the prediction and performance function.
The later part of the project involves the use of Random Forest and they prove to be a better model as for each random forest the data is randomly selected for the training and testing set and I inferred that if one tried to create a number of CART models to make up a Forest it will not be possible as for each iteration of CART model will build the same tree and there will not be any difference.
The random forest involves the use of a trade of parameter between the complexity and accuracy on the training set.
I inferred that 
•	Smaller CP value lead to bigger trees which are often overfit
•	Large CP value will lead to the formation of rather smaller trees which may be underfit or too simple.
